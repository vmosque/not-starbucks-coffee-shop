☕ Overview

Not Starbucks is a fast–paced pixel-art coffee-making game inspired by retro arcade aesthetics.
Serve drinks, satisfy picky superhero customers, survive the growing difficulty across days, and avoid running out of lives!

This project was built in pure HTML + CSS + JavaScript, without game engines — fully custom logic and UI.

🎮 Gameplay

Customers arrive with a random order (Latte, Mocha, Espresso, Cappuccino…).

You must pick ingredients from the shelf and assemble the drink in the correct order.

Press BREW (or SPACE) to submit.

Correct drink → Score +10

Wrong / Timeout → Lose 1 Life

Serve enough customers → Advance to the next day
